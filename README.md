## Introduction  
In this case study, I analyze historical data from a Chicago-based bike-share company to identify trends in how their customers use bikes differently. To answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act**.  

The main tools I used are **Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Power BI**.

## Scenario  
As a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, my role is to help uncover insights that drive business growth. The **Director of Marketing** believes that the key to the company‚Äôs future success lies in increasing the number of annual memberships.  

To support this goal, my team is focused on analyzing how **casual riders and annual members** differ in their usage of Cyclistic bikes. By identifying key trends and patterns, we aim to develop an effective marketing strategy that encourages casual riders to become annual members.  

Before implementing any strategy, our recommendations must be reviewed and approved by **Cyclistic‚Äôs executives**. To ensure a strong case, we will support our findings with **data-driven insights and professional visualizations** that clearly communicate the value of our proposed approach.  

---

## Background  
Cyclistic is a bike-share program that operates **5,800+ bicycles across 600 docking stations**. What sets Cyclistic apart is its commitment to inclusivity, offering:  
- Traditional bikes  
- Reclining bikes  
- Hand tricycles  
- Cargo bikes (for riders with disabilities)  

While **most users prefer traditional bikes**, about **8% opt for assistive options**. The majority of riders use Cyclistic for **leisure**, though **30% rely on it for commuting** to work.  

### Pricing Model  
Cyclistic offers **three pricing plans**:  
- **Single-ride passes**  
- **Full-day passes**  
- **Annual memberships**  

Customers using **single-ride or full-day passes** are classified as **casual riders**, while those who purchase **annual memberships** are considered **Cyclistic members**.  

### Business Challenge  
Financial analysis has shown that **annual members** are significantly **more profitable** than casual riders. Instead of attracting **new customers**, the Director of Marketing believes that **converting casual riders into annual members** will be crucial for Cyclistic‚Äôs long-term success.  

To achieve this goal, we need a **deeper understanding** of:  
- How **casual riders** and **annual members** differ in their bike usage  
- Why casual riders **might** buy a membership  
- How **digital marketing strategies** could influence their decision

# Data Analysis Process  

## Phase 1: Ask ‚Äì Defining the Problem  

### **Business Task**  
**Devise marketing strategies to convert casual riders to members.**

### **Analysis Questions**  
Three key questions guide the marketing strategy:  
1. **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**  
2. **Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?**  
3. **How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?**

## Phase 2: Prepare ‚Äì Gather and Organize Data  

### **Data Source**

### **Data Organization**

- `ride_id` (Primary Key)  
- `rideable_type`  
- `started_at`, `ended_at`  
- `start_station_name`, `end_station_name`  
- `start_lat`, `start_lng`, `end_lat`, `end_lng`
