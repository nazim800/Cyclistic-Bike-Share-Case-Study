**Introduction**
In this case study, I analyze historical data from a Chicago based bike-share company in order to identify trends in how their customers use bikes differently. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
The main tools I used are Microsoft Excel, SQL and PowerBI.
